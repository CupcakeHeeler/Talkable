Woah another tts generator

The goal of this tts generator is to create natural sounding voices based off of previous characters

## Help wanted!

Are you willing to put in the effort to help contribute to this project?
If so, please add some audio samples of the characters saying a word in the proper directory. Make sure the file is the name of what they're saying, AND it is in **.wav** format.

Thanks
